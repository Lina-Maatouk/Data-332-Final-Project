![ReduceToxicSubtances](https://github.com/Lina-Maatouk/Data-332-Final-Project/assets/108307724/61c8ace4-6aad-4cc6-b3e6-88f418890356)

## Introduction: 

This project focuses on analyzing toxic chemical releases in the United States, with a specific emphasis on California (CA) and New York (NY) in 2021, aiming to uncover correlations with chronic diseases. Through advanced statistical techniques and data visualization in R, we explore potential associations between toxic releases and chronic disease prevalence rates. Additionally, we have developed a predictive model using historical data from 2018 to 2021 to forecast chemical releases in CA, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding environmental regulations and public health initiatives. This repository provides access to datasets, analysis scripts, prediction models, and insightful results, enabling further exploration and understanding of the complex relationship between toxic chemical releases and chronic diseases.


## Dependencies: 
* This code is an R script.
* The dataset needed is also provided in the following link: https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present and https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi

## 1. US Toxic release in 2021:biohazard:

- For the US dataset, we created sub data frames to see how the chemicals rate changes by region. We used filter function as showns below:

![USsubdataframe](https://github.com/Lina-Maatouk/Data-332-Final-Project/assets/118494394/837b69f1-47a5-45ee-a27d-550dc96a12dc)

- Then, we trimmed the sub datasets to focus on the top 10 chemical released.

### Toxic release in California: 

Next, we decided to narrow our focus and chose to analyze the data from California. We combined the past datasets from 2018 to 2021 and build a prediction model using an LLM (OpenAI). 

![CAcleaning](https://github.com/Lina-Maatouk/Data-332-Final-Project/assets/118494394/2bea709b-65cd-4927-81b2-0dcef3781b4e)

### Prediction Model:

![CAprediction](https://github.com/Lina-Maatouk/Data-332-Final-Project/assets/118494394/83190e62-2875-4e44-935e-5c071d992a73)

OpenAI recommends this prediction model because it incorporates best practices for data collection, preprocessing, and modeling techniques. The model gathers data from multiple years (2018 to 2021) and applies appropriate data cleaning and transformation methods to handle missing values and ensure accurate analysis. By leveraging the caret package, the model employs a linear regression approach to establish a relationship between the year and on-site release total, enabling predictions for future years. The Shiny app interface enhances user experience by providing interactive data visualization and prediction capabilities, allowing users to explore and interpret the chemical release data effectively. With its comprehensive approach and user-friendly interface, this prediction model exemplifies the principles of robust data analysis and holds the potential to provide valuable insights into chemical releases in California.


#### Shiny app:

Please find the following link to access an interactive Shiny app that provides various features for exploring chemical releases data:

https://linamaatouk.shinyapps.io/Chemical-Release-Analysis/

Within the app, you will find the option "Chemical Releases by Region," allowing you to filter and select specific regions of interest. By doing so, you can view the total values of released chemicals and visualize the data through an intuitive bar chart. It is noteworthy that Nitrate stands out as the most prevalent chemical released across all regions.

Moreover, the app offers the choice to explore "Chemical Releases in California" specifically. Here, you can select a specific chemical name of interest and utilize the prediction feature to generate a data plot showcasing predicted values for the upcoming years.
The Shiny app also includes a geospatial map feature, where red markers represent facilities. By clicking on these markers, you can access information on the chemicals released by each facility in the year 2021.

### Analysis: 

Our analysis shows that the highest chemical released by most facilities in the US is nitrate compounds, raising serious concerns about their potential impact on chronic diseases. Nitrate compounds, commonly found in industrial and agricultural activities, have been associated with an increased risk of developing various chronic illnesses. When ingested or absorbed into the body, nitrates can undergo chemical reactions that convert them into nitrite and nitrosamines, known to be harmful substances. Nitrosamines, extensively studied, have been linked to the development of certain types of cancer such as stomach, bladder, and colon cancer, due to their ability to damage DNA, disrupt cellular processes, and promote the growth of cancerous cells. Long-term exposure to high nitrate levels through contaminated water or nitrate-rich foods may contribute to the initiation and progression of these chronic diseases. Moreover, excessive nitrate intake can lead to methemoglobinemia, or "blue baby syndrome," particularly harmful to infants as it reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. To mitigate the risks associated with nitrate compounds and chronic diseases, it is crucial to regulate their release into the environment, implement stricter pollution control measures, improve wastewater treatment systems, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Regular monitoring of nitrate levels in drinking water sources and raising awareness about the potential health impacts are also vital for protecting public health.

## 2. Toxic release in NYC:biohazard:


### 1.	GeoSpatial Map

Its interactive map of New York state using the Leaflet package in R. The map would display circle markers at different locations on the map, representing various facilities.

Each circle marker represents a specific facility, and when clicked, a popup window would appear with additional information about that facility. The information displayed in the popup includes:

Facility Name: This would show the name or identifier of the facility represented by the marker.
State: It indicates the state where the facility is located, providing additional geographical context.
Zip Code: This shows the zip code associated with the facility's location.
Compound Released: It displays the information about the chemicals that were released or associated with the facility.
Street Address: This provides the street address of the facility's location, offering a more precise identification.

The use of Leaflet in this code allows for the visualization of geographic data in an interactive and visually appealing manner. It enables the exploration of facility locations, provides additional information about each facility through popups,


     ny_map <- leaflet() %>%
      setView(-75.3470, 42.6953, zoom = 7) %>%
      addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron")

    # Convert the data frame to a leaflet-compatible format
    df_coords <- data.frame(lat = df_1$latitude, lng = df_1$Longitude, 
                            state = df_1$state, facility_name = df_1$facility_name,
                            zip = df_1$zip, chemicals = df_1$chemicals,Street_Address = df_1$Street_Address )

    # Add the markers to the map
    ny_map <- ny_map %>%
      addCircleMarkers(data = df_coords, 
                       lng = ~lng, 
                       lat = ~lat, 
                       radius = 5, 
                       color = ~state,
                       fillOpacity = 0.5,
                       popup = ~paste("Facility Name: ", facility_name, "<br>State: ", state, "<br>Zip Code: ", zip, "<br>Compound Released:",chemicals, "<br>Street Address:",Street_Address))

    # Show the map
    ny_map 

### 2. Chemical Count By Metal Catagories 

This Is plot visualizing the count of chemicals by different metal categories. Both bars represent a metal category, one show chemicals that contain metal and the other is nonmetal. 

When individuals are exposed to these metals over an extended period, they can accumulate in the body, particularly in organs like the liver, kidneys, and brain. The persistent presence of metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium can disrupt the normal functioning of these organs, leading to chronic toxicity and the development of diseases. Furthermore, certain metals can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body, causing oxidative stress. Chronic oxidative stress can damage cells, proteins, and DNA, contributing to the onset of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Additionally, metals can interfere with essential enzyme systems and disrupt the immune system, leading to further health complications. Overall, the potential for chronic diseases arises from the accumulation, oxidative stress, enzyme disruption, and immunotoxicity caused by metals in chemical compounds.

        Metal_table <- df_1 %>%
      group_by(Metals) %>%
      summarize(Count = n())

    ggplot(Metal_table, aes(x = Metals, y = Count, fill = Metals)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      labs(title = "Chemicals Count by Metal Categories", x = "Metals", y = "Count") +
      theme_minimal()

### 3. Facilty Count by Industry Sector 

plot visualizing the count of facilities by different industry sectors. Each bar represents an industry sector, 


Various industries mentioned in the provided list can have the potential to contribute to chronic diseases. For instance, industries involved in the production or use of chemicals may pose health risks if proper safety measures and regulations are not in place. 

Exposure to certain chemicals can lead to chronic health issues such as respiratory problems, neurological disorders, cancers, and systemic diseases. Electric utilities, particularly those reliant on fossil fuels, can contribute to air pollution and emit harmful pollutants, which have been linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and chronic conditions. Certain sectors within the food industry, such as fast food or processed food manufacturing, can promote unhealthy diets and contribute to chronic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Industries associated with petroleum products and primary metals may pose risks through exposure to toxic substances and pollutants, potentially leading to chronic health problems such as respiratory issues, skin disorders, and developmental disorders. It is important to note that the specific impact on health depends on various factors, including industry practices, regulations, and safety measures implemented to mitigate health risks.

        Industry_sector<- df_1 %>%
          group_by(Industry_Sector) %>%
          summarize(Count = n())


        ggplot(data =Industry_sector , aes(x = Industry_Sector, y = Count)) +
          geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
          labs(x = "Industry Sector", y = "Count", title = "Count of Facilities by Industry Sector")+
          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

### 4. Top Chemicals Finished 

plot visualizing the top 10 chemicals based on their on-site release totals.

We did this to show that repeated exposure to certain chemicals can increase the risk of chronic health issues. For example, carcinogenic chemicals like benzene or certain metals can lead to the development of cancer over time. 


Other chemicals can impact the respiratory system and contribute to chronic conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neurotoxic chemicals can affect the nervous system, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders or neurological diseases. Some chemicals may disrupt reproductive and developmental processes, increasing the risk of fertility issues, hormonal disruptions, and birth defects. Certain metals can cause organ damage, such as kidney damage or neurological impairments. Additionally, some chemicals can have systemic effects, contributing to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune system dysfunction. It's important to understand that the potential for these chemicals to cause chronic diseases depends on various factors, including exposure levels, duration of exposure, individual susceptibility, and regulatory measures in place to minimize risks. Responsible handling, safety protocols, and adherence to regulations are crucial to mitigate potential health hazards and ensure the well-being of individuals and the environment.

        chemicals <- df_3$chemicals
        on_site_release_total <- df_3$on_site_release_total

        # Change zeros to NA in the on_site_release_total column and drop NAs
        df_3$on_site_release_total <- ifelse(df_3$on_site_release_total == 0, NA, df_3$on_site_release_total)
        df_3 <- df_3 %>% drop_na()


        # Order the data frame by decreasing on-site release total
        df_3_ordered <- df_3[order(-df_3$on_site_release_total),]

        df_3_ordered <- df_1 %>%
          arrange(desc(on_site_release_total))

        # Get the top 10 chemicals by on-site release total
        top_10_chemicals <- df_3_ordered %>%
          top_n(12, on_site_release_total)

        # Create a bar plot showing the top 10 chemicals by on-site release total
        ggplot(head(df_3_ordered, 10), aes(x = chemicals, y = on_site_release_total)) +
          geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
          labs(x = "Chemicals", y = "On-site release total", title = "Top 10 Chemicals Released") +
          theme_minimal() +
          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


## 3. Chronic Disease:
To choose the columns to work with, get a sample set of rows and clean the data  we used the following code:
```R
df<-read.csv("U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_ (1).csv")

df_1 = df[,c(1,3,4,6,7,18,23,24)]

df_1$Lat <- as.numeric(gsub("[()]", "", df$Lat))
df_1$Lon <- as.numeric(gsub("[()]", "", df$Lon))
df_1 <- df_1[complete.cases(df_1), ]

num_rows <- 1000  # Specify the number of rows you want

# Get a random subset of 'num_rows' rows from the dataset
subset <- dplyr::sample_n(df_1, num_rows, replace = FALSE)
saveRDS(subset, file = "subset.rds")

#By locataion
location_topic <- subset %>% 
  group_by(LocationAbbr,Topic) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(Total = n())


write.csv(location_topic, "location_topic.csv", row.names = FALSE)
saveRDS(location_topic, file = "location_topic.rds")
df_3<-location_topic%>%
  arrange(desc(location_topic$Total))

write.csv(location_topic_desc, "location_topic_desc.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### To read the clean data for the web app:
```R

# Assuming 'subset_data' is a valid data frame with the required columns
subset_data <- readRDS("subset.rds")
location_topic_data <- readRDS("location_topic.rds")

# Get unique values of 'LocationAbbr' column
unique_locations <- unique(subset_data$LocationAbbr)
```
